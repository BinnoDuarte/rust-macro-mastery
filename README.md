## 📚 Function Descriptions: Power in Every Detail

**macro_fold**  
Automatically generates concise expansion logic for folding operations across arbitrarily complex data types, eliminating ceremony with adaptive trait detection.

**derive_reflective**  
A meta-macro that introspects struct or enum fields and auto-implements printing, hashing, diffing, and serialization in a single invocation—adaptively selecting best-fit crates for your platform.

**parallel_enumerate!**  
Executes for-loops in parallel, with built-in channel-based synchronization, progress reporting, and granular error bubbling.

**ai_suggest_macro!**  
Invokes OpenAI or Claude API to suggest optimization, refactoring, or safety enhancements directly for a given code segment—feeds results as Rust macro snippets with inline docs.

**error_mapper**  
Wraps any function with enhanced, chained error handling, mapping translatable error messages for multi-language environments.

**macro_timer**  
Instrument your blocks to report real-world and CPU time for macro expansion in dev/test mode—ideal for performance-oriented coders.

**dynamic_injector!**  
Runtime-injects extra logic, hooks, or logging into macro-expanded code, allowing live changes (and reversions) even after deployment.
